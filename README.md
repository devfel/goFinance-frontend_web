In this ReactJS application I contined to develop the transaction management application named GoFinances that already have a backend. 
Now, along with the use of TypeScript, routes, and sending files, the application will connect to the previous created backend and display the transactions. Also it is possible now to import a CSV file to generate new records in the database.

## üßê Application features <a name = "about"></a>

- **_List the backend's API transactions:_** the Dashboard page should be able to display a listing through a table, with the title, value, type and category field for all transactions that are registered in the API.
- **_Display the balance:_** On the Dashboard page, it is possible to check the balance that is returned from the backend, containing the income total, the outcome total and the final balance.
- **_Import CSV files:_** the Import page allow users to send a file in csv format to your backend, which will import the transactions into your database.

With this application the user is able to:<br/>
