In this ReactJS application I contined to develop the transaction management application named GoFinances that already have a backend. 
Now, along with the use of TypeScript, routes, and sending files, the application will connect to the previous created backend and display the transactions. Also it is possible now to import a CSV file to generate new records in the database.

## üßê Application features <a name = "about"></a>

- **_List the backend's API transactions:_** the Dashboard page should be able to display a listing through a table, with the title, value, type and category field for all transactions that are registered in the API.
- **_Display the balance:_** On the Dashboard page, it is possible to check the balance that is returned from the backend, containing the income total, the outcome total and the final balance.

1. list the transactions <br/>
1. upload a file
